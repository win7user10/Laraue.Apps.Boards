# Laraue.Apps.Boards
The repository contains backend for Task-management Jira-like system.

## App structure

### Laraue.Apps.Boards.DataAccess
The layer that contains models and enums associated with these models

### Laraue.Apps.Boards.Services
The layer with services that use other services. Required to encapsulate hard logic mostly in CRD operations.  
Example: issue creation may update `updated_at` property, add record to history changes etc.  
So the service provides the method to create issue.

**Note:** core services should not manage transactions, but may require them calling `context.Database.EnsureTransaction`
at the top of function.

### Laraue.Apps.Boards.WebApiServices
Services to call from WebApi

### Laraue.Apps.Boards.TelegramServices
Services to call from TelegramApi

## Permissions arch
Application permissions are divided into two parts:
1. Entity permissions. Allows to set up access to organization spaces, epics, issues
    1. Organization level. Make set for all entities in one time.
    2. Flexible setup for each space separately. Can be combined with organization level.
2. Administrative permissions. They allow to set up access for administrative actions like renaming organization.
